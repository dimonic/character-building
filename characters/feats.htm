<h1>Feats</h1>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p> Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the
indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus,
or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A
character can gain a feat at the same level at which he or she gains
the prerequisite.
</p>
<p>
	A character can’t use a feat if he or she has lost a prerequisite.
</p>

<h2 id="typesOfFeats">Types Of Feats</h2>
<p> Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them
as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow spellcasters to
create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster
prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell
were a higher spell level than it actually is.
</p>

<h3 id="fighterBonusFeats">Fighter Bonus Feats</h3>
<p>
	Any feat designated as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a>
feat can be selected as a fighter’s bonus feat. This designation does
not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats,
assuming that they meet any prerequisites.
</p>
<p>
	Fighter bonus feats include:

<h3 id="itemCreationFeats" style="clear: both;">Item Creation Feats</h3>
<p> An item creation feat lets a spellcaster create a magic item of a
certain type. Regardless of the type of items they involve, the various
item creation feats all have certain features in common.
</p>

<h5 id="xPCost">XP Cost</h5>
<p> Experience that the spellcaster would normally keep is expended
when making a magic item. The XP cost equals 1/25 of the cost of the
item in gold pieces. A character cannot spend so much XP on an item
that he or she loses a level. However, upon gaining enough XP to attain
a new level, he or she can immediately expend XP on creating an item
rather than keeping the XP to advance a level.
</p>

<h5 id="rawMaterialsCost">Raw Materials Cost</h5>
<p>
	The cost of creating a magic item equals one-half the sale cost of the item.
</p>
<p> Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or
magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has
access to what he or she needs unless unusual circumstances apply.
</p>

<h5 id="time">Time</h5>
<p>
	The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item. The minimum time is one day.
</p>

<h5 id="itemCost">Item Cost</h5>
<p>
	<a href="#brewPotion">Brew Potion</a>, <a href="#craftWand">Craft Wand</a>, and <a href="#scribeScroll">Scribe Scroll</a>
create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of
these items depends on their caster level—that is, a spell from such an
item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that
level. The price of these items (and thus the XP cost and the cost of
the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level
must be high enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the
spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the
caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a
constant, as shown below:
</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		<em>Scrolls:</em> Base price = spell level × caster level × 25 gp.<br>
		<em>Potions:</em> Base price = spell level × caster level × 50 gp.<br>
		<em>Wands:</em> Base price = spell level × caster level × 750 gp.
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of ½ for the purpose of this calculation.
</p>

<h5 id="extraCosts">Extra Costs</h5>
<p> Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly
material component or an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. For
potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component or
pay the XP cost when creating the item.
</p>
<p>
	For a wand, the creator must expend fifty copies of the material component or pay fifty times the XP cost.
</p>
<p>
	Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components or XP, as noted in their descriptions.
</p>

<h3 id="metamagicFeats">Metamagic Feats</h3>
<p> As a spellcaster’s knowledge of magic grows, she can learn to cast
spells in ways slightly different from the ways in which the spells
were originally designed or learned. Preparing and casting a spell in
such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, at
least it is possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell
slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell,
so the DC for <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">saving throws</a> against it does not go up.
</p>

<h5 id="wizardsandDivineSpellcasters">Wizards and Divine Spellcasters</h5>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#wizard">Wizards</a>
and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During
preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with
metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots
than normal).
</p>

<h5 id="sorcerersandBards">Sorcerers and Bards</h5>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#sorcerer">Sorcerers</a> and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/bard.htm">bards</a>
choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their
spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with
other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell
slot. But because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a
metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the
spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a
metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast
a regular spell. If the spell’s normal casting time is 1 <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions">standard action</a>, casting a metamagic version is a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions">full-round action</a> for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn’t the same as a 1-round casting time.)
</p>
<p>
	For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions">full-round action</a> to cast the spell.
</p>

<h5 id="spontaneousCastingandMetamagicFeats">Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/cleric.htm">cleric</a>
spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell can cast a metamagic
version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case.
Casting a 1-action metamagic spell spontaneously is a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions">full-round action</a>, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast.
</p>

<h5 id="effectsofMetamagicFeatsonaSpell">Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell</h5>
<p> In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell
level, even though it is prepared and cast as a higher-level spell. <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">Saving throw</a> modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.
</p>
<p> The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast
directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can’t use a metamagic feat to
alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.
</p>
<p>
	Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don’t eliminate the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm">attack of opportunity</a> provoked by casting a spell while threatened. However, casting a spell modified by <a href="#quickenSpell">Quicken Spell</a> does not provoke an attack of opportunity.
</p>
<p> Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific
feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can’t modify.
</p>

<h5 id="multipleMetamagicFeatsonaSpell">Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell</h5>
<p> A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell.
Changes to its level are cumulative. You can’t apply the same metamagic
feat more than once to a single spell.
</p>

<h5 id="magicItemsandMetamagicSpells">Magic Items and Metamagic Spells</h5>
<p> With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic
version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for
potions and wands apply to the spell’s higher spell level (after the
application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn’t need the
metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a
spell.
</p>

<h5 id="counterspellingMetamagicSpells">Counterspelling Metamagic Spells</h5>
<p> Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does
not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to
counterspell another spell.
</p>

<h2 id="featDescriptions">Feat Descriptions</h2>
<p>
	Here is the format for feat descriptions.
</p>

<h3 id="featNameTypeOfFeat">Feat Name [Type Of Feat]</h3>

<h5 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h5>
<p> A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base
attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or a
class level that a character must have in order to acquire this feat.
This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have
more than one prerequisite.
</p>

<h5 id="benefit">Benefit</h5>
<p> What the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description)
to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do
not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

<p>
	In general, having a feat twice is the same as having it once.
</p>

<h5 id="normal">Normal</h5>
<p> What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or
restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular
drawback, this entry is absent.

<h3 id="blindFight">Blind-Fight [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	In melee, every time you miss because of <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#concealment">concealment</a>, you can reroll your miss chance percentile roll one time to see if you actually hit.
</p>
<p>
	An <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#invisible">invisible</a>
attacker gets no advantages related to hitting you in melee. That is,
you don’t lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class, and the attacker
doesn’t get the usual +2 bonus for being invisible. The invisible
attacker’s bonuses do still apply for ranged attacks, however.
</p>
<p> You take only half the usual penalty to speed for being unable to
see. Darkness and poor visibility in general reduces your speed to
three-quarters normal, instead of one-half.
</p>

<h5>Normal</h5>
<p>
	Regular <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a>

</p>

<h3 id="brewPotion">Brew Potion [Item Creation]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	Caster level 3rd.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p> You can create a potion of any 3rd-level or lower spell that you
know and that targets one or more creatures. Brewing a potion takes one
day. When you create a potion, you set the caster level, which must be
sufficient to cast the spell in question and no higher than your own
level. The base price of a potion is its spell level × its caster level
× 50 gp. To brew a potion, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP
and use up raw materials costing one half this base price.
</p>
<p> When you create a potion, you make any choices that you would
normally make when casting the spell. Whoever drinks the potion is the
target of the spell.
</p>
<p> Any potion that stores a spell with a costly material component or
an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs
derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or
pay the XP when creating the potion.
</p>

<h3 id="cleave">Cleave [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>
	Str 13, <a href="#powerAttack">Power Attack</a>.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p> If you deal a creature enough damage to make it drop (typically by
dropping it to below 0 hit points or killing it), you get an immediate,
extra melee attack against another creature within reach. You cannot
take a 5-foot step before making this extra attack. The extra attack is
with the same weapon and at the same bonus as the attack that dropped
the previous creature. You can use this ability once per round.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Cleave as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="combatCasting">Combat Casting [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +4 bonus on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/concentration.htm">Concentration</a> checks made to cast a spell or use a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities">spell-like ability</a> while on the defensive or while you are <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#grappling">grappling</a> or <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#pinned">pinned</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="combatExpertise">Combat Expertise [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>

<h3 id="improvedFamiliar">Improved Familiar [General]</h3>
<p>
	This feat allows spellcasters to acquire a new <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#familiars">familiar</a> from a nonstandard list, but only when they could normally acquire a new familiar.
</p>

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>
	Ability to acquire a new familiar, compatible <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment">alignment</a>, sufficiently high level (see below).
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	When choosing a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#familiars">familiar</a>, the creatures listed below are also available to the spellcaster. The spellcaster may choose a familiar with an <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment">alignment</a> up to one step away on each of the alignment axes (lawful through chaotic, good through evil).
</p>

<p> Improved familiars otherwise use the rules for regular familiars,
with two exceptions: If the creature’s type is something other than
animal, its type does not change; and improved familiars do not gain
the ability to speak with other creatures of their kind (although many
of them already have the ability to communicate).
</p>
<p>
	The list in <a href="#tableImprovedFamiliarbyAlignment">Table: Improved Familiar by Alignment</a>
presents only a few possible improved familiars. Almost any creature of
the same general size and power as those on the list makes a suitable
familiar. Nor is the master’s <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment">alignment</a>
the only possible categorization. For instance, improved familiars
could be assigned by the master’s creature type or subtype, as shown in
<a href="#tableImprovedFamiliarbyTypeSubtype">Table: Improved Familiar by Type/Subtype</a>.

<h3 id="leadership">Leadership [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	Character level 6th.
</p>

<h5 id="benefits">Benefits</h5>
<p> Having this feat enables the character to attract loyal companions
and devoted followers, subordinates who assist her. See the table below
for what sort of cohort and how many followers the character can
recruit.
</p>

<h5 id="leadershipScore">Leadership Score</h5>
<p> A character’s base Leadership score equals his level plus any
Charisma modifier. In order to take into account negative Charisma
modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but the
character must still be 6th level or higher in order to gain the
Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect a character’s Leadership
score, as detailed above.
</p>

<h5 id="cohortLevel">Cohort Level</h5>
<p> The character can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless
of a character’s Leadership score, he can only recruit a cohort who is
two or more levels lower than himself. The cohort should be equipped
with gear appropriate for its level. A character can try to attract a
cohort of a particular race, class, and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment">alignment</a>.
The cohort’s alignment may not be opposed to the leader’s alignment on
either the law-vs-chaos or good-vs-evil axis, and the leader takes a
Leadership penalty if he recruits a cohort of an alignment different
from his own.
</p>
<p>
	Cohorts earn XP as follows:
</p>
<p>
	The cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party’s XP.
</p>
<p> Divide the cohort’s level by the level of the PC with whom he or
she is associated (the character with the Leadership feat who attracted
the cohort).
</p>
<p>
	Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to the PC and add that number of experience points to the cohort’s total.
</p>
<p> If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than
the associated PC’s character level, the cohort does not gain the new
level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed attain the next
level.
</p>

<h5 id="numberofFollowersbyLevel">Number of Followers by Level</h5>
<p> The character can lead up to the indicated number of characters of
each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they’re generally
low-level NPCs. Because they’re generally five or more levels behind
the character they follow, they’re rarely effective in combat.
</p>
<p> Followers don’t earn experience and thus don’t gain levels.
However, when a character with Leadership attains a new level, the
player consults the table above to determine if she has acquired more
followers, some of which may be higher level than the existing
followers. (You don’t consult the table to see if your cohort gains
levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.)
</p>

<h5 id="leadershipModifiers">Leadership Modifiers</h5>
<p> Several factors can affect a character’s Leadership score, causing
it to vary from the base score (character level + Cha modifier). A
character’s reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or
follower he is trying to attract) raises or lowers his Leadership
score, see <a href="#tableReputation">Table: Reputation</a>.
</p>

<p>
	Other modifiers may apply when the character tries to attract a cohort, see <a href="#tableAttractingCohorts">Table: Attracting Cohorts</a>.
</p>

<p> Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When the
character tries to attract a new follower, use any of the modifiers
that apply on <a href="#tableAttractingFollowers">Table: Attracting Followers</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="lightningReflexes" style="clear: right;">Lightning Reflexes [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +2 bonus on all <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex">Reflex saving throws</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="magicalAptitude">Magical Aptitude [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +2 bonus on all <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/spellcraft.htm">Spellcraft</a> checks and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/useMagicDevice.htm">Use Magic Device</a> checks.
</p>

<h3 id="manyshot">Manyshot [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>
	Dex 17, <a href="#pointBlankShot">Point Blank Shot</a>, <a href="#rapidShot">Rapid Shot</a>, base attack bonus +6
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	As a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions">standard action</a>, you may fire two arrows at a single opponent within 30 feet. Both arrows use the same <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a> (with a -4 penalty) to determine success and deal damage normally (but see Special).
</p>
<p> For every five points of base attack bonus you have above +6, you
may add one additional arrow to this attack, to a maximum of four
arrows at a base attack bonus of +16. However, each arrow after the
second adds a cumulative -2 penalty on the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a> (for a total penalty of -6 for three arrows and -8 for four).
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction">Damage reduction</a> and other resistances apply separately against each arrow fired.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	Regardless of the number of arrows you fire, you apply precision-based damage only once. If you score a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#criticalHits">critical hit</a>, only the first arrow fired deals critical damage; all others deal regular damage.
</p>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Manyshot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>
<p>
	A 6th-level <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm">ranger</a>
who has chosen the archery combat style is treated as having Manyshot
even if he does not have the prerequisites for it, but only when he is
wearing light or no armor.
</p>

<h3 id="martialWeaponProficiency">Martial Weapon Proficiency [General]</h3>
<p>
	Choose a type of <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#simpleMartialandExoticWeapons">martial weapon</a>. You understand how to use that type of martial weapon in combat.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You make <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a> with the selected weapon normally.
</p>

<h5>Normal</h5>
<p>
	When using a weapon with which you are not <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency">proficient</a>, you take a -4 penalty on <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a>.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/barbarian.htm">Barbarians</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighters</a>, <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/paladin.htm">paladins</a>, and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm">rangers</a> are <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency">proficient</a> with all <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#simpleMartialandExoticWeapons">martial weapons</a>. They need not select this feat.
</p>
<p>
	You can gain Martial Weapon Proficiency multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of weapon.
</p>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/cleric.htm">cleric</a>
who chooses the War domain automatically gains the Martial Weapon
Proficiency feat related to his deity’s favored weapon as a bonus feat,
if the weapon is a martial one. He need not select it.
</p>

<h3 id="maximizeSpell">Maximize Spell [Metamagic]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows">Saving throws</a>
and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random
variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher
than the spell’s actual level.
</p>
<p> An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each
feat: the maximum result plus one-half the normally rolled result.
</p>

<h3 id="mobility">Mobility [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>
	Dex 13, <a href="#dodge">Dodge</a>.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +4 <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus">dodge bonus</a> to Armor Class against <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm">attacks of opportunity</a>
caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition
that makes you lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also
makes you lose dodge bonuses.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus">Dodge bonuses</a> stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Mobility as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="mountedArchery">Mounted Archery [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/ride.htm">Ride</a> 1 rank, <a href="#mountedCombat">Mounted Combat</a>.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p> The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is
halved: -2 instead of -4 if your mount is taking a double move, and -4
instead of -8 if your mount is running.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Mounted Archery as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="mountedCombat">Mounted Combat [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/ride.htm">Ride</a> 1 rank.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/ride.htm">Ride</a> check (as a reaction) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/ride.htm">Ride</a> check result is greater than the opponent’s <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a>. (Essentially, the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/ride.htm">Ride</a> check result becomes the mount’s Armor Class if it’s higher than the mount’s regular AC.)
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Mounted Combat as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="naturalSpell">Natural Spell [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>
<p>
	Wis 13, wild shape ability.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p> You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while
in a wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the
normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.
</p>
<p> You can also use any material components or focuses you possess,
even if such items are melded within your current form. This feat does
not permit the use of magic items while you are in a form that could
not ordinarily use them, and you do not gain the ability to speak while
in a wild shape.
</p>

<h3 id="negotiator">Negotiator [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +2 bonus on all <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/diplomacy.htm">Diplomacy</a> checks and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/senseMotive.htm">Sense Motive</a> checks.

</p>

<h3 id="persuasive">Persuasive [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +2 bonus on all <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/bluff.htm">Bluff</a> checks and <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/intimidate.htm">Intimidate</a> checks.
</p>

<h3 id="pointBlankShot">Point Blank Shot [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Point Blank Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="powerAttack">Power Attack [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	Str 13.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	On your action, before making <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a>
for a round, you may choose to subtract a number from all melee attack
rolls and add the same number to all melee damage rolls. This number
may not exceed your base attack bonus. The penalty on attacks and bonus
on damage apply until your next turn.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p> If you attack with a two-handed weapon, or with a one-handed weapon
wielded in two hands, instead add twice the number subtracted from your
<a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack rolls</a>. You can’t add the bonus from Power Attack to the damage dealt with a light weapon (except with <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#unarmedStrike">unarmed strikes</a> or <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#naturalWeapons">natural weapon</a> attacks), even though the penalty on attack rolls still applies. (Normally, you treat a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#doubleWeapons">double weapon</a>
as a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. If you choose to use a
double weapon like a two-handed weapon, attacking with only one end of
it in a round, you treat it as a two-handed weapon.)
</p>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Power Attack as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="preciseShot">Precise Shot [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	<a href="#pointBlankShot">Point Blank Shot</a>.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You can shoot or throw ranged weapons at an opponent engaged in melee without taking the standard -4 penalty on your <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll">attack roll</a>.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Precise Shot as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="quickDraw">Quick Draw [General]</h3>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	Base attack bonus +1.
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	You can draw a weapon as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions">free action</a> instead of as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions">move action</a>. You can draw a hidden weapon (see the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/sleightOfHand.htm">Sleight of Hand</a> skill) as a move action.
</p>
<p>
	A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).
</p>

<h5>Normal</h5>
<p>
	Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions">move action</a>, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions">free action</a> as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions">standard action</a>.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/fighter.htm">fighter</a> may select Quick Draw as one of his fighter bonus feats.
</p>

<h3 id="quickenSpell">Quicken Spell [Metamagic]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	Casting a quickened spell is an <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#swiftActions">swift action</a>.
You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same
round as you cast a quickened spell. You may cast only one quickened
spell per round. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 full round
action cannot be quickened. A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four
levels higher than the spell’s actual level. Casting a quickened spell
doesn’t provoke an <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm">attack of opportunity</a>.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p> This feat can’t be applied to any spell cast spontaneously
(including sorcerer spells, bard spells, and cleric or druid spells
cast spontaneously), since applying a metamagic feat to a spontaneously
cast spell automatically increases the casting time to a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions">full-round action</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="rapidReload">Rapid Reload [General]</h3>
<p>
	Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy).
</p>

<h5>Prerequisite</h5>
<p>
	Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).
</p>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions">free action</a> (for a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowHand">hand</a> or <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowLight">light crossbow</a>) or a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions">move action</a> (for a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#crossbowHeavy">heavy crossbow</a>).

scribe a scroll, you must spend 1/25 of this base price in XP and use
up raw materials costing one-half of this base price.
</p>
<p> Any scroll that stores a spell with a costly material component or
an XP cost also carries a commensurate cost. In addition to the costs
derived from the base price, you must expend the material component or
pay the XP when scribing the scroll.

<h3 id="track">Track [General]</h3>

<h5>Benefit</h5>
<p>
	To find tracks or to follow them for 1 mile requires a successful <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/survival.htm">Survival</a> check. You must make another <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/survival.htm">Survival</a> check every time the tracks become difficult to follow.
</p>
<p> You move at half your normal speed (or at your normal speed with a
-5 penalty on the check, or at up to twice your normal speed with a -20
penalty on the check). The DC depends on the surface and the prevailing
conditions, as given on <a href="#tableTrackDC">Table: Track DC</a>.
</p>

<h5 id="verySoftGround">Very Soft Ground</h5>
<p>
	Any surface (fresh snow, thick dust, wet mud) that holds deep, clear impressions of footprints.
</p>

<h5 id="softGround">Soft Ground</h5>
<p> Any surface soft enough to yield to pressure, but firmer than wet
mud or fresh snow, in which a creature leaves frequent but shallow
footprints.
</p>

<h5 id="firmGround">Firm Ground</h5>
<p> Most normal outdoor surfaces (such as lawns, fields, woods, and the
like) or exceptionally soft or dirty indoor surfaces (thick rugs and
very dirty or dusty floors). The creature might leave some traces
(broken branches or tufts of hair), but it leaves only occasional or
partial footprints.
</p>

<h5 id="hardGround">Hard Ground</h5>
<p> Any surface that doesn’t hold footprints at all, such as bare rock
or an indoor floor. Most streambeds fall into this category, since any
footprints left behind are obscured or washed away. The creature leaves
only traces (scuff marks or displaced pebbles).
</p>
<p>
	Several modifiers may apply to the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/survival.htm">Survival</a> check, as given on <a href="#tableTrackDCModifiers">Table: Track DC Modifiers</a>.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/survival.htm">Survival</a> check, you can retry after 1 hour (outdoors) or 10 minutes (indoors) of searching.
</p>

<h5>Normal</h5>
<p>
	Without this feat, you can use the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/survival.htm">Survival</a> skill to find tracks, but you can follow them only if the DC for the task is 10 or lower. Alternatively, you can use the <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/search.htm">Search</a> skill to find a footprint or similar sign of a creature’s passage using the DCs given above, but you can’t use <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/search.htm">Search</a> to follow tracks, even if someone else has already found them.
</p>

<h5>Special</h5>
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm">ranger</a> automatically has Track as a bonus feat. He need not select it.
</p>
<p>
