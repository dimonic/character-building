<h3>Design Philosophy</h3>

<p>Having used a whole bunch of character sheet generators, I have
found certain things to be true. Those that attempt to calculate
everything completely can either only do so for a small part of the
possible ruleset (from the growing number of books out there), or they
are too buggy for typical real world use (or both).</p>

<p>I have therefore attempted a middle-approach. Where possible and
reasonable, I have auto-calculated things, and included things from
databases. I have also intentionally left certain variable final
calculations out, such as the actual attacks for a particular melee
weapon, or the character's total AC, because there are so many feats,
special abilities, enhancements etc. that can impact these, that I
doubt the ability of software to keep up with them and their
interactions. During the data-capture process I do "suggest" certain
values, but leave the user to key in many of their own values in the
end.</p>

<p>I have also attempted to have my character sheets closely resemble
the standard Wizard's (particularly the RPGA) character sheets, except
where certain enhancements in detail capability could be included
without great loss of clarity or radical layout changes. This is in
order for DMs and players to be able to quickly find things.</p>
