<h2>Battle</h2> 

<h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>These are rules intended to integrate PCs (and anti-heroes) into
  medium and large scale battles.</p>

  <p>The design focuses on moving the large scale stuff along swiftly,
  and focussing on the character actions as much as possible.</p>

  <p>Here are some of the key design considerations for the battle
  resolution system.</p>

  <h4>Design Considerations</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>speedy resolution</li>

    <p>at least 75&perc; of the 'face-time' should be spent resolving
    PC and anti-hero activities.</p>

    <li>simple</li>

    <p>the new rules should require a minimum of look-ups, die rolling
    or calculation.</p>

    <li>easy integration</li>

    <p>existing rules wil be used for all PC and anti-hero
    actions.</p>

    <li>large scale action-results not forced on PCs</li>

    <p>Such as unit losses from large scale action. The system will
    use morale and initiative modifiers caused by large-scale action
    results to modify PC bonuses.</p>

    <li>PCs have the opportunity for a significant impact on outcome</li>

    <p>the rules will use intiative and morale modifiers based on PC
    abilities and levels that will modify troop unit values when PCs
    are embedded or commanding them.</p>

    <p>Additionally, sucessful (or unsuccessful) outcome of specific
    PC actions will modify unit initiative and/or morale.</p>

  </ul>
