<h2>Design Notes</h2> 

<h3>What have we done?</h3>

  <p>In a nutshell, we have slowed down <a
  href="classes/spellcasters.php" title="Spell progression tables for
  all casters"> spellcasters' (and psion's) spell (power)
  acquisition</a> somewhat, allowing 7th level spells by level 19, and
  delaying 9th level spells until 25th level. This falls in between
  the "all spell-casters must be evenly multiclassed" route taken by
  Andy Collin's Umber campaign, and the status quo, in terms of the
  maximum spell levels achievable. It also has the effect of weakening
  primary spellcasters, but not to the degree that might be initially
  thought: because many spell effects are scaled by caster level, even
  though the caster does not gain access to certain high levels as
  quickly, they can still cast their lower level spells with
  increasing power as they level up. We have also given them a few
  extra feats (mostly to soften the blow), and supplied a <a
  href="classes/prestige-classes.php#martial-training">martial
  training</a> prestige class to give the spell caster even more
  flexibility.</p>

  <p>We have also <a href="economics.php" title="Economics of the
  campaign world"> scaled back the cash</a> dramatically, dividing
  starting money by 10, and the "cash" component of treasure by the
  same amount (thanks, Andy), which will weaken non-spell casters the
  most (by way of balancing out the other big change).</p>

  <p>Other changes are minor tweaks by comparison, on a par with ideas
  floating around in many other published and web campaign ideas.</p>

<h3>Why Tinker with Magic Levels?</h3>

  <h4>The Problem</h4>

  <p>We have discovered through play that Dungeons and Dragons 3rd
  edition, while providing the best D&D experience so far, and scaling
  perhaps better than any previous edition, begins to leave its "sweet
  spot" somewhere between 9 and 15 levels of advancement.</p>

  <p>Specifically, certain spells and magical abilities allow
  characters and enemies to do things which are drastic, and may have
  an unravelling effect on the underlying game world. Magical travel,
  powerful divinations, creation and healing spells all begin to make
  the game seem more and more contrived. Whether as a DM you can
  tolerate this only to 9th level, or you can accommodate it up to
  16th, the ceiling is there: it practically becomes a different game,
  and one that is not necessarily to the tastes of the ones who
  gravitated towards the genre in the first place.</p>

  <p>There is a sense of diminishing returns for players, too. Players
  of rogues and fighters that have spent levels honing and using their
  skills and capabilities find that a wizard or cleric can make them
  redundant with the wave of a finger or a quick prayer. After
  acquiring a +6 ability item or two, characters find themselves in
  the strange position of refusing magic items, or regularly "trading
  them in" for cash or better stuff. Characters become walking
  "magic-shops" laden with amulets, bracers, robes, cloaks, vests,
  belts, goggles, circlets, boots, gloves, rings, ioun stones, weapons
  and armor. Adventures can degenerate into <em>scry, buff, teleport,
  force cage, plunder, mordnificent mansion, repeat</em>. Magic begins
  to feel mundane, and there is a feeling of artificiality about it
  that makes willing suspension of disbelief harder (perhaps more so
  for us old fashioned folk).</p>

  <h4>Goals</h4>

  <p>The goal of these revisions and house rules is to extend the
  gaming "sweet spot" farther into higher levels. To make the game
  scale better, and to restore the sense of mystery and wonder we
  experienced in days gone by when we discovered a new and wonderful
  magic item, uncovered a deadly trap, or encountered a terrible
  creature.</p>

  <p>The style of these revisions will not be for everyone. They lean
  towards a more 'realistic', or simulationist style of game, with
  emphasis on characters and strategy rather then magic and
  character-design tactics.</p>


<h3><a href="magic.php" title="Detailed design notes about lowered magic">Low magic premise</a></h3>

  <p>One of the key underlying premises to these house rules is that
  the campaign world is relatively low magic. That is to say, it does
  not have actual magic shops, magic items are rarer than the DMG
  would suggest, and members of PC classes are also <a
  href="npc-occurence.php" title="NPC frequency table">rarer</a> than
  the DMG indicates. This is in aid of placing the <em>characters</em>
  front and centre in the game. The players want to remember their
  character's actions, not just a long list of "wicked stuff" they
  wore to accomplish their aims (although these rules also set out to
  make that list feel much more special).</p>

<h3><a href="player-characters.php" title="Rules affecting character design and character classes">Player Characters</a></h3>

  <p>Some of the most important changes are those made to character
  classes. Spellcasters in particular have been adjusted, and wealth
  reduced all round.</p>

  <p>We think that reduced wealth and magic item acquisition will hurt
  non-spellcasters the most, bringing them in line with the now
  reduced spellcasters themselves.</p>

<h3><a href="encounters.php" title="Effect of changes on encounters">Encounter Levels and Challenge Ratings</a></h3>

  <p>Some advice for DMs (and assurances for players) on the
  consequences of lowerd magic and encounter level problems.</p>

<h3><a href="economics.php" title="Details on the economics of the campaign world">Economics</a></h3>

  <p>Economics is one of the key reasons we have felt the need to
  introduce these rule changes. The default game setting can lead to
  paradoxical/hard to model situations, where people are in a quasi
  mediaeval situation at the same time as permanent magics can be made
  to zip people around at no per-use cost, food can be "created", and
  all manner of diseases and even death "healed".</p>
