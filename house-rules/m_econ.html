<h1>Medieval Economics</h1>
by Philip McGregor
<p><em>This was originally a two part article in NFB23 &amp; 24, 1978/80.</em>
</p><p>When I recently saw Phanarzul's article on Economics (NFB22) I
was interested to see his conclusions on how to revise the pitifully
inadequate economic system provided in D&amp;D.
While it was an interesting article, I felt that it did not explain as
fully as possible the reasons which make a Medieval economy the most
realistic to use in a Fantasy or D&amp;D style world.
</p><p> Before I am drowned out by the many anguished howls from those
DMs who will claim that "my world is not Medieval - so it doesn't need
a medieval economy" I would like to point out that the term 'Medieval
economy' does not merely refer to that which existed in Europe in the
period after the fall of the Roman Empire - what it does refer to is a
pre-industrial economy.
</p><p> Thus if your society is pre-industrial it will have the
following general characteristics: a population that is mostly involved
in subsistence agriculture (85% or more), with the few Urban dwellers
involved in at most handcraft level industries that rarely employ more
than 2-3 workers. The general level of technology is fairly low due to
a lack of a large enough leisured middle class to stimulate industry
into creating technological advances.
</p><p> Unless your society is reasonably close to the above structure
you are moving towards the process of industrialisation that resulted
in the great technological and scientific advances of the Renaissance -
something D&amp;D is not suited to fit in with.
</p><p> The major limiting factor in a Medieval/pre-industrial society
is the extreme fragility of the urban concentrations that provide what
limited amounts of manufactured goods there are - as well as providing
the basis for future developement into an industrialising society. As I
have noted above, 85% or more of a county's population will be involved
in more or less subsistence agriculture. In fact, some conservative
estimates show that it required at least 10 farmers to support every
urban dweller.
</p><p> The obvious factor here is that any reduction of the number of
farmers, whether by war or by plague, is going to result in a similar
reduction in the number of Urban dwellers, mainly through starvation
but also because of a loss of rural markets for their manufactured
goods.
</p><p> There were 4 major reasons for this fragility. Firstly, the
initial lack of a suitable plough, which limited cultivation to
thinner, less fertile lands until about 1000 AD. Secondly, the use of
biennial crop rotation, which left half of all cultivable land fallow
each year until the introduction of triennial rotation about 800 AD,
which left only a third fallow. Thirdly, the use of oxen as draught
animals rather than the twice as efficient horse, due to poor harnesses
which which tended to choke a horse limiting loads to about 250lbs. In
the 800's a new type of harness was introduced that increased load
capacity fivefold. Finally, the very low
agricultural productivity which varied between a return of 3 to 4.7
times the amount of grain sown, and from which next year,s seed had to
be taken.
</p><p> The limited chemical knowledge of the time meant that only the
richest bullion mines could be operated. This, coupled with the fact
that a token currency had not yet been thought of, meant that there was
not enough gold or silver to go round. This in turn meant that frequent
and massive currency debasements were neccessary to meet the growing
need for currency that increasing trade and industry demanded. The
problem became so bad that at one stage 'silver' shillings minted in
Germany contained <strong>no silver at all</strong>. These problems
naturally caused a rollercoaster ride of depressions and recoveries, as
well as limiting economic development and growth.
<img src="m_econ_files/irony.gif" alt="[Cartoon 6K]" align="left" height="341" width="379">
</p><p> Two final limiting factors are also important to note. These
were the shortage of iron and the uncertainty of transport in the
Medieval period. Iron was in very short supply due to inefficient
working methods and because deep shaft mining was impossible without
powered water pumps. This meant that iron tools and utensils were rare,
and were used mainly by the rich and well-to-do, with bronze items
being used by the great mass of the people.
</p><p> The shortage of iron also meant.that chain or scale mail was
easier and cheaper to make - despite the long hours of labour involved
- than full plate, which would have been incredibly expensive, even if
enough iron could be found to construct it. The shortage was so acute
that many ironworkers depended on scrap metal for raw materials for
much of the period involved.
</p><p> Since the breakdown of law and order that came with the fall
of the Roman Empire the major and the safest form of transport became
sea transport. Yet even this medium was not all that it could have
been, as the compass had not yet been invented and thus sea travel
was limited almost totally to coast hugging except for a few well known
routes, mainly in the Mediterranean.
</p><p> These then were the major limiting factors on the development
of the Medieval world that a DM should keep in mind when developing his
D&amp;D campaign.
</p><p> But what do they mean in game terms, one might well ask. Well,
Chaots can no longer go around slaughtering innocent farmers, unless
they wish to starve to death. Famine is a real possibility with the
margin of cereal production so low. Heavy land transport will move at
the slow pace of teams of oxen, and ships will be very slow also,
hugging the coastline all the time. Finally, most warriors will be
armed in chain or scale mail at best, unless they are incredibly
wealthy (successful Dungeon adventurers maybe?).
</p><h2>Wages</h2> The important thing to remember is that actual
money (coinage) was scarce - and only those who possessed it could buy
manufactured goods. This meant that Serfs/Villeins/Peasants operated on
a barter economy, doing without manufactured goods for the most part.
The market for such items was limited to the richer peasantry (Yeomen),
the landed Gentry, rich merchants, and the Nobility. However, even
within these classes money wasn't plentiful, and the supply could dry
up very quickly (especially after a bad harvest, when all free coinage
went towards buying food - after all, you can't eat a new sword!)
making the Demand Factor for manufactured goods very elastic.
<p> As already indicated, the only item for which demand cannot be cut
by too much is, of course, food. During the Medieval period, the major
type of food consumed was cereal (wheat, corn, maize etc) with meat and
fish being relatively scarce. Fortunately we can determine that the
average annual consumption of cereals worked out at 300kg per person,
or 1200kg for the average family of four. We also know the average
number of working hours available annually, and with these two pieces
of information it becomes easy to work out average wages - if we know
food prices.
</p><pre>England 1320    160kg cereal cost 37 shillings
France 1339-69  100kg of cereal cost 50 shillings
</pre>Thus in England the minimum hourly wage had to be 1.75 pence.
Similarly in France it would be 2.5d. In most cases of course this food
would have been grown by the family themselves, or in the case of
labourers in cities provided by their employers. On top of this, there
would almost certainly have been a payment in cash; to the farmer this
would have been in the form of extra crops for barter. Such paymerits
would probably have been on a similar scale to that suggested next:
<pre>Unskilled Labourer   ½d/day    3½d/week
Skilled Labourer     1-2d/day  7-14d/week
Skilled Craftsman    3-6d/day  14-42d/week
</pre>
This gives an average conjectural weekly wage as follows:

<pre>                      France   England
Unskilled Labourer    15¾d     21d
Skilled Labourer      19-26d   24-31d
Skilled Craftsman     34-54d   38-59½d</pre>

<p> Those persons who are self-employed would have to pay for their own
food as well as making a bit extra if possible out of their profits.
</p><h2>Prices</h2> Now that we have an idea of the wages paid to
labourers, we can work out what items would have cost if we know how
long it took to produce a particular item. For instance, Chainmail took
12 months to produce (a suit down to the knees, with long sleeves and
integral hood and mittens) and Plate Armour took 24 months - probably
by a team consisting of a Master Craftsman, Skilled Craftsman and two
Skilled Labourers Thus Chainmail would cost about 676 shillings in
labour alone; it is reasonable to assume that profit and materials
would boost this by 100% giving us a 'for sale' cost of 1352 shillings,
or about £67. Plate Armour would cost about twice as much, say £134. If
we also remember that the major armour producing areas (for Plate
Armour anyway) were in Italy and Germany, we must add middleman profits
depending on distance end safety of travel of say 50-100%, bringing us
to £201 - £268. This latter price tallies with the known price paid by
an English King for a suit of Plate during the Hundred Years War of
5000s.
<p> Of course armour was a luxury item and profits were charged
accordingly. Second or third hand Armour may have cost a quarter of the
new price. Other items would probably have less excessive profit
margins, being from 10-50% at each step.
</p><p> NB - DON'T use the times for production given by TSR or Judges
Guild, as they are more the result of wishful thinking than any real
knowledge of Medieval production times.
