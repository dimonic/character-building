<h3>Hit Points and Death</h3>

<h4>Hit points</h4> 

  <p>PCs start with maximum hit points at first level, plus any
  bonuses. At each level thereafter, they receive the median HP, round
  to odd at odd levels, even at even levels. Eg: a rogue receives 4 HP
  at level 2, 3 HP at level 3 before bonuses.</p>

  <p>As campaign specific option we will use the <a
  href="reserve-points.html">Reserve points</a> option from Unearthed
  Arcana.  This option is designed to improve survivability in
  campaigns where there is reduced magical healing available.</p>

<h4>Raise dead</h4>

  <p>If a character should be so fortunate as to be raised from death,
  the usual rules and costs apply. The character will, however be at
  the <em>mid-point</em> of the level below their level at time of
  death. This is to give some incentive to raising the character over
  that of creating a new character. Also note that XP earned in the
  dying encounter still accrue to the character on being raised.</p>

  <p>If your character dies without the means to restore him to life,
  you may start a new character. (see <a
  href="player-characters.php#starting-level">Starting level in existing
  campaign</a> above).</p>

<h5>Other notes on death/resurrection</h5>

  <p>In order not for resurrection to remain purely a wealth issue
  here are some further ideas:</p>

  <p>I like the idea of bargaining with the deity (perhaps requiring
  travel or other communication to the appropriate plane to bargain in
  person). There could be a simple table of modifiers to the debate,
  which would end as something like a diplomacy check. The deity's
  negotiator would have a scroll of the deceased's deeds, and the
  party member/caster would have to justify why it would best serve
  that deity's interest to restore the soul to life. Of course many
  factors would be highly subjective, but I could see bribes (we will
  build a church/mission), quests, past behaviour (exemplary servant
  of the church), future need (the leader of a fragile resistance
  movement the deity supports) all being major factors. Even the track
  record of the caster: have their past resurrectees lived (pun
  intended) up to expectations (look, of the last 3 of your
  resurrections, the first failed to protect my temple, the second is
  here in front of me again, and the third spends more time in the bar
  than the temple).</p>

  <p>A thing to bear in mind is that the deity has the soul at this
  time.  Restoring it will not guarantee that the soul will come back
  to this deity later. (bird in the hand).</p>

  <p>This will also have the side effect of making players more
  concerned about their PC's religious choices, and how they serve
  their god(s).  This may or may not be a good thing depending on you
  and your players.</p>


<h4>What happens to my stuff if I die?</h4>

  <p>It is assumed your heirs or relatives expect to receive notice of
  your demise, and any of your personal effects, as well as any wealth
  you may have accumulated as your share of adventuring.</p> <p>Using
  the deceased's magic sword <em>while on the way, directly, to
  deliver said item to the family</em> is ok. Party members may
  <em>not</em> designate one another as heirs without express prior DM
  permission.</p>
