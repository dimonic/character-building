<h3>Formula</h3>
<h4>Turn DC</h4>
<blockquote>Undead HD + Turn Resistance (if any)</blockquote>
<h4>Modifiers to roll</h4>
<blockquote>CL + Cha mod.</blockquote>
<h4>Total HD turnable per day:</h4>
<blockquote>(Cha mod. + 3) &times; CL</blockquote>

<p>Where CL is the character's level in a class that has the "Turn
Undead" class feature. If a feat uses one of your "turn undead"
attempts such as <em>Divine Might</em>, subtract (Cha mod. + 3) from
remaining "undead HD turnable" total.</p>

<h3><a name="procedure">Procedure</a></h3>
<p>The player rolls a <b>d20, adds charisma modifier + CL</b>. </p>
<ol>
<li>Starting with the undead closest to the Cleric, and moving away, for each undead, 
determine if the HD of the undead would be within the character's remaining HD turnable 
for the day</li>
<li>if <em>yes</em>, then:</li>
  <ol type=a>
  <li>Determine the turn DC for the undead: (<b>HD + turn resistance</b>)</li>
  <li>Compare the PC's modified result with the DC: if equal or greater, the undead is
  turned, as usual, otherwise, the attempt has no effect</li>
  <li>Move on to the next undead in range</li>
  </ol>
<li>if <em>no</em>, then skip this undead and move on to the next</li>
</ol>
