    <p><em>Must</em> choose to specialize at first level.</p>

<p><b>Militant wizard:</b> As an alternative to taking a familiar, a
wizard could opt to be more combative. Such a Wizard may choose one
additional Weapon group, and uses the base attack progression of the
rogue. Additionally, in place of their normal bonus feats, a militant
wizard may take a fighter feat (not including fighter only feats).</p>

<p><b>Spontaneous Metamagic:</b> I present a 
<a href="../downloads/metamagic_feats.pdf">feat system</a> to make
metamagic more user friendly, and allow its use it at earlier
levels.</p>
