<h2><a name="cleric">Cleric</a></h2>

<p>Other than spell progression, I wanted to address the clerics "turn
undead" class feature, which I consider broken in the standard game. I
have designed a <a href="#turn_undead">variant rule</a>, which
addresses the problems, and makes turn undead a more viable, smoothly
scaling power.<p>

<p>In addition to modifying the cleric's spell progression, I have
broken the class down into two main options: the player may choose
either the turn undead class feature, and suffer scaled back combat
abilities, or lose the turn undead class feature, and keep the base
attack bonus. In my view this leaves the Paladin as a more viable,
distinct option for the player who wants a good melee combatant with
undead turning.</p>
