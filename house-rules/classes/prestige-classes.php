    <p><b><a name="fetish">Occult fetish:</a></b> at 3rd level, the
    Student of the Occult can create a special type of magic item
    known as a fetish. A fetish takes up a body location "slot"
    according to the design of the creator. For example, a fetish may
    be made as a necklace, headgear, or a ring, or any other location
    as desired.  The fetish is a single spell storing item of maximum
    level 3, which activates when the condition appropriate to its use
    occurs, for example: a fetish for Bull's Strength would activate
    when the character begins exerting themselves strenuously, such as
    in combat, or lifting a heavy load. A fetish for Cure Light Wounds
    would activate when the wearer took damage, or when the wearer
    drops below 0 hit points (creator's option). The spell has all
    normal effects as if cast by the creator once activated, including
    duration. Treat the fetish as a potion for gold and experience
    point cost. The Student must find an appropriate incantation for
    the spell they wish to use.</p>
