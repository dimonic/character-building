<h2>Lowered Magic</h2> 

  <h3>This is still D&D</h3>
 
  <ul>

  <li>All standard character classes are still there (and we have
  tried our best to keep their 'feel' intact).</li>

  <li>You <em>can</em> still have your favourite races, classes,
  class-combos and a few more besides.</li>

  <li>You can still have you favourite <a
  href="magic-items.php">magic items</a> (you will simply have to
  find them, or make them).</li>

  <li>Your favourite (read: sacred cow) spells are all intact.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We wanted to preserve the classic core character classes of the
  game, and their relative strengths and weaknesses. In our view, for
  better or worse, class specialisation is a hallmark feature of the
  D&D game. Wizards are stil combat-weak wielders of great arcane
  power. Clerics still draw power from divine sources to further their
  deity's aims in the mundane world. We also wanted there to be magic
  items, both useful and powerful, but rare (and unique) enough to be
  truly treasured by those lucky enough to have them.</p>

  <h3>Game Impact of Lowered Magic</h3>

  <p>The reduced availability of magic has many ramifications in the
  game. Players may not assume routine availability of items, potions,
  scrolls, or even other spell casters. There will be a dearth of
  magical texts that wizards could expand their knowledge
  with. Magical schools, universities or other associations are
  unknown. On the divine side, churches are run by mostly by
  <i>experts</i> (albeit very devout ones), and the most likely <a
  href="npc-occurence.php">"naturally occurring"</a> occasional
  spell-casters will be adepts. These adepts, or minor actual clerics
  of their faith will be sought after, and will often travel from town
  to town performing "miracles" on behalf of the faithful as they go,
  visiting each diocese as "proof" of their deities power. Others will
  exist outside the establishment, perhaps as recluses or hermits, or
  as the elders of their communities, but unknown outside their self
  proclaimed sphere.<p>

  <p>For you, there will be little use running to the temple for
  <i>raise dead, remove disease</i> or even <i>cure light wounds</i>
  my friends! If magical curing is to be had, you must cast it
  yourselves, or go in search for it. That is why you are
  adventurers.</p>

  <h3>Some Advantages</h3>

  <p>On the up side: castles will actually be useful bastions of
  defense. Towns and villages will look and feel mediaeval. People
  (including adventurers) will walk or ride through potentially
  dangerous areas to get where they are going (instead of teleporting,
  flying or wind walking). Diseases, floods, fires and invasions can
  occur without a lone wizard or cleric putting everything to rights
  or routing the entire opposing army! Pilgrims will journey from all
  around to a healer or shrine reputed to have divine powers.</p>

  <p>This will be an intensely challenging game. Many monsters will be
  significantly harder to kill, or even to hit with less
  magic. Optimum strategy will be required for success. This includes
  the strategy of <em>running away</em>. However, remember that the
  game is for everyone to enjoy. It is by no means designed to kill
  your character, but to provide a challenging world to adventure in,
  with a flavour more reminiscent of Lord of the Rings than
  Dragonlance, or King Arthur rather than Elminster.</p>

  <h3><a  name="incantations">Incantations</a></h3>

  <p>In order to heighten the atmosphere, (and partly as a DM out) we
  may introduce "Incantations" (from Unearthed Arcana) from time to
  time in the game. They will only become available as "found" ancient
  texts, or obscure folklore, and no known mechanism to create them
  exists.</p>

  <h3>New Magic Items</h3>

  <p>We have introduced a new prestige class, the <a
  href="classes/prestige-classes.php#occult-student">Student of the
  Occult</a>, who have the ability to create a new category of magic item:
  the <a href="classes/prestige-classes.php#fetish">Fetish</a> . This
  item is intended to be a useful, but with a flavour suited to a low
  magic world.</p>
