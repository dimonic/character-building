<h2>Player Character Rules</h2>

<h3><a name="abilities">Abilities</a></h3>

  <p>PC's use the point buy system as outlined in DMG, with points
  from 28 to 32 depending on the specific campaign. For familiars,
  mounts, animal companions, use MM stats. For Followers (for
  characters with Leadership feat), use MM stats, and NPC classes
  only, for a Cohort, use Elite Stats (and DMG NPC list for example
  and equipment).</p>

<h3><a name="starting-level">Starting level in existing campaign</a></h3>

  <p>If joining (or re-joining) the ongoing campaign, you will start
  at the beginning of the level below the lowest level existing party
  member.</p>

<h3><a name=level-up">Leveling Up</a></h3>

  <p>We will use some suggestions from the DMG (pages 197+) for
  determining how players will access new skills, class abilities and
  feats as they level up. We will require that characters have some
  exposure to the situation in which they might use the new skill or
  feat, and/or some type of formal training in the new skill, ability
  or feat. In game terms, this can be represented in terms of
  practice: attempting the task untrained at some point(s) during the
  previous level, formal training with an instructor, or study of some
  puisant manual. Use the DMG's costs and training times for
  professional instruction.</p>

  <p>Likewise, wizards must spend some time in actual research to
  acquire new spells and add them to their spellbooks. See pages 198 in
  the DMG, and 178 in the PHB for details.</p>

  <p>It is understood that this will slow down progression. However,
  in order to allow characters to move forward in a time constrained
  scenario, albeit at some disadvantge, characters may advance hit
  points, saves and base attack bonus without training.</p>

  <p>It is our intention to take steps as DMs to ensure that so much
  experience point do not accrue from a single days adventure that
  characters may have "wasted" XPs in excess of those required to
  advance to the top of the next level.</p>

<h3><a name="equipment">Equipment</a></h3>

  <p>For PCs, use maximum starting gold for 1st level, but read it as
  <em>silver pieces</em>, or for higher level characters use DMG table
  5-1 (page 135) for starting wealth, but divide by 2. In other words,
  only 50% of the default wealth at higher levels. This is a lowered
  magic world, and the intention is for it to have a grittier, more
  mediaeval flavour. If you can't live with this, then this is not the
  campaign for you!</p>

  <p>See the page on <a href="economics.php" title="Design notes on
  campaign economy"> economics</a> for more details on this.</p>

  <p>We have introduce some <a
  href="economics.php#wealth-feats">characteristics</a> that allow
  characters to modify their starting wealth up or down.</p>

  <p>On a game mechanics note: all magic/special items found as
  treasure or made by PCs will be written on index cards. When the
  item changes hands, so will the index card. If you don't have the
  card, you don't have the item. If the property is not mentioned on
  the card, the item does not have that property (yet). The DM may
  give out cards with nothing but the description and an index number,
  and the player may discover more properties as time goes by. This
  card will even be used to track object HP (such as rope, weapons),
  and numbers of charges.</p>
 
<h3><a name="hp">Hit points</a></h3>

  <p>PCs start with maximum hit points at first level, plus any
  bonuses. At each level thereafter, they receive the median HP, round
  to odd at odd levels, even at even levels. Eg: a rogue receives 4 HP
  at level 2, 3 HP at level 3 before bonuses. See also <a
  href="death.php">Death and damage</a></p>

<h3><a href="races.php" title="Adjustments to standard races"">Races</a></h3>

  <p>I have made minor adjustments to standard races, to give them a
  better "flavour" in my world, or to redress some slight grievances I
  may have with the system. There are also some changes designed to
  make some of the EL adjusted races playable from level one, an idea
  shamelessly borrowed from Andy Collins' Umber campaign notes.</p>

<h3><a href="classes/" title="Character class adjustments">Classes</a></h3>

  <p>I have made significant adjustments to the main spellcasting
  classes, to lower their rate of spell progression. I want to make
  magic feel very special, not something that can be seen on any
  street corner. The occurence and levels of <a
  href"npc-occurence.php">spellcasters as NPCs</a> is also much
  reduced.</p>

<h3><a href="other-rules.php" title="Other house rules">Other rule changes</a></h3>

  <p><a href="other-rules.php#languages">Languages</a> and <a
  href="other-rules.php#literacy">literacy</a> are determined by new
  rules that reduce access to "book learning", again to reflect a
  "darker" middle ages, and other changes to standard 3.5 are
  here.</p>

  <p><a href="other-rules.php#keen">Some feat/ability stuff is
  changed.</a></p>

  <p><a href="other-rules.php#saves">Modified saves.</a></p>
