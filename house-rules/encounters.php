<h3><a name="encounters" title="Effect of changes on encounters">Encounter Levels and Challenge Ratings</a></h3>

  <p>These changes will have some effects on challenge ratings of many
  creatures, and on appropriate encounter levels. Certain creatures
  will be more powerful against a low magic party, particularly those
  creatures with immunities and damage reduction. We suggest that
  <em>for purposes of determining encnouter levels</em>, those types
  of creature be considered as being at least 1 CR higher than their
  listed value where appropriate. Spell using creatures, or those with
  spell-like abilties should also either have their spell-levels
  scaled back in line with the classes presented here, or have their
  CRs adjusted upwards <em>for purposes of calculating EL</em>. Great
  care must be taken to ensure that PCs will have the means to defeat
  monsters (that are intended to be defeated). There are some effects
  or immunities that would present an overly tough barrier without the
  appropriate counter magic.</p>

  <p>Note that we are not saying that we will increase experience
  point awards. We are only adjusting CRs from the point of view of
  avoiding a total party knockout. For purposes of determining
  experience point awards, we feel it is ok that the encounters will
  often be tougher, although the rewards will not increase. This will
  slow down progression through killing, and allow a slower overall
  pace to level advancement. We consider that this is a desirable
  effect on a long term campaign. To us, a campaign world with 20th
  level wizards who are 19 years old is somewhat absurd, and would
  inevitably lead to a world that is chock full of magical
  technology.</p>
