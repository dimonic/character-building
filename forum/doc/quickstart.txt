Documentation - Quickstart Guide

After you downloaded the newsportal archive, uncompress it
   and move the files inside into a directory of your webserver.
   There are only a few options in config.inc.php that you have to edit
   to let newsportal run:
     * $file_language: Your favourite language-package.
     * $server: The adress of your newsserver
     * $port: The port of your newsserver, normaly this is 119

   Security related options:
     * Set $readonly=true, if you don't want users to post articles to
       groups.

   To customize the output you can change the following values:
     * $treestyle: 0-7, different thread-layouts. Just try out. Normally
       7 should be the right for you
     * $maxarticles: The maximal number of articles that newsportal loads
       from the newsserver. If the number is too high NewsPortal will
       slow down.
     * $articles_per_page: Maximum amount of articles showed on one page.
       0 if you don't want to split the thread into several pages.
