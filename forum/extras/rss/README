A very simple RSS backend.

Copy this file to your newsportal-directory, and edit it to configure it.

Note, that this skript doesn't connect to any newsserver, it just reads the
contents of your newsportal-spooldir. So if you don't actualize this
directory by viewing the group with newsportal, the RSS-feed won't be
actualized.
