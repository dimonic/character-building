If you don't have a own newsserver, or your groups are empty because no one
likes to write anything, you may want to use the babbel-net groups.

This groups are german only! Only use them an sites in german language.

in config.inc.php, set $server="babbel.gartenhaus.net"
and copy the groups.txt in this directory to your newsportal installation
directory.

The Website of the Babbel-Net: http://babbel.gartenhaus.net
