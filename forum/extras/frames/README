Here are some files that help you to setup the framed version of NewsPortal.

1. Copy all files in this directory to your main NewsPortal directory

2. Uncomment the commented lines in the frames-sertion in your
   config.inc.php

3. add/change the lines in the first section of config.inc.php:
 $file_thread="thread_frameset.php";
 $file_framethread="thread.php";

Now threading should run, but you should change the layout of your files a
bit. For example, thread.php has this "write" and "newsgroups" buttons, that
you could remove, or you could also make changes in your tail.inc

The frames-support and the files in this directory are just examples, how
you could implement frames-support. They will not work right out of the box
without changes in layout.
