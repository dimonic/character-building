<h1>Age of Worms Campaign Notes</h2>
<h2>Campaign Begins</h2>
<h3>Saturday, 11th March 2006</h3>
<h4>The Party</h4>

<p>Aldo Chaffers, male halfling rogue originally from Highfolk,
Anastasia, female elven aristocrat once of Celene, and Creudic, male
human ranger from Stonehold meet by chance in the small mining town of
diamond lake. It all started as they were onlookers in the gathering
crowd after news of a mine disaster spread through the town.</p>

<h4>Trapped!</h4>
<p>A mine supervisor was calling on bystanders for help in the mine,
to recover survivors. It appeared that Smenk, the owner was for
shutting things down, and "containing" the problem. Aldo began working
the crowd, repeating that Smenk was willing to let the trapped men
die. Creudic stepped up to the foreman and offered help, after which,
Anasasia and Aldo stepped forward.</p>

<h4>The Dragon</h4>
<p>In the mine, the new party quickly arrived at the scene, and
discovered three skeletons pressing two remaining miners hard. The
skeletons were quickly dispatched, and one miner rescued. On further
investigation, a strange pool was discovered, from which came a deadly
large bone-dragon. After a strategic withdrawal (in spite of a
spirited fight by the halfling), the party regrouped and returned to
finish off the deadly foe with makeshift weapons more suited to its
skeletal nature. Creudic takes the teeth of the beast, and fashions a
pendant, and suggests they call themselves the "Dragon's Teeth". The
others accept, and each take a tooth. The oddest thing was the runes
denoting Hextor, Erythnull <em>and</em> Vecna inscribed on the
skeletons and the pool's rim. These were deities that should
definitely not be mixed! Creudic gained a nifty flail, and Aldo some
special boots in this adventure.</p>

<h4>Hard Pressed</h4>
<p>Two months later, the party meet again at an abandoned
mine-administration office to discuss a foray into Whispering Cairns,
a location known to Aldo. It is a place where local stories have it
that it was a place local kids would hang out, daring one another to
stay the night in its strange, whispering caves, until a few years ago
when a young lady disappeared. They are joined by a young Dwarf,
Dragna, of noble lineage, who is interested in signing up.  During the
planning phase, they are interrupted by a press-gang for a local
mine. No-one is going to "draft" Aldo to work underground again. He
loses it. He snaps. Over-reacts. A sling shot to the head: the sucker
goes for it. The rest of the party join in, and before the dust
settles, there are three bodies buried in the back yard, and one in
the basement. Is that "employment opportunities in the shafts" enough
for you asks Aldo? The body of the chief has three potions which are
divvied up amongst the party. There is nothing to do but to rest the
night, and head to the Cairns in the morning.</p>


<h4>Whispering Cairns</h4>
<p>At the Cairns, the party defeat a wolf-pack although sustaining
some injuries. A strange light seen on and off turns out to be a
stationary lantern seen through webs a long way in. The back chamber
houses the Sarcophagus of an Auran angel-like being, with alcoves each
lit by a lantern of a colour of the rainbow. The blue lantern leads to
a deadly trap which attempts to blow characters to their deaths. Good
group efforts minimize the damage, and the party lives on. Another
trap in the sarcophagus does a little harm to the brawny Stoneholder,
but a strange elevator contraption appears in response to swivelling
the Sarcophagus around. The party takes it to the lower level. Below,
first Aldo, then Anastasia struggle through a narrow gap, to find
themselves attacked by an abberation that beams fear and sleep at
them, while flitting around, avoiding attack. As Creudic struggles to
join them, they join battle with the creature: a Lurking Strangler. It
eventually succeeds in putting Aldo to sleep, but Anastasia defends
him, waking him up. Together they renew their efforts, and slay the
creature. Creudic joins them, and they explore another Auran's
chamber, where a previously triggered trap is re-opened to reveal an
interesting pair of goggles, and an eye-dropper which are claimed by
Aldo, a shirt of mithral chain and a strange hammer that Creudic
claims. Somewhere along the way, Anastasia obtains an ornate
leaf-patterened arm-bracer.</p>
