<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Knight Class (Chapter 1: New Classes) </b></p>
<p align="left"><b>KNIGHT</b></p>
<p align="left"><i><img src="knight_class_files/dx0501ex_97101.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="251" width="240">"I offer you surrender or an honorable death in battle. The choice is yours."</i></p>
<p align="left">-- Archibold the Impetuous</p>
<p align="left">A knight is a proud, skilled melee combatant who fights
in the name of honor and chivalry. A knight relies on more than a sharp
sword and a stout suit of armor to defeat her foes. Her drive,
determination, and fighting spirit allow her to control the battlefield
in ways that others cannot match. A knight can challenge an opponent to
a duel, calling upon the foe's pride and ego to force his hand. The
knight's talent with heavy armor, shields, and defensive tactics grant
her the ability to disrupt her foe's plans. Only the most talented
rogues and monks can slip past a knight's defenses to strike at her
allies. An adventuring group with wizards, sorcerers, and other lightly
armored members thrives with the assistance of a knight. While the
knight keeps enemies occupied, her allies can use their talents and
abilities without fear of attack or harassment.</p>
<p align="left">The knight class is a great choice if you want to play
a tough, durable melee combatant whose strong personality allows you to
manipulate your foes. Weaker foes cower in fear before you, while
stronger foes move to strike you rather than your allies when you play
on their egos and challenge them to duels. Your expertise in using
armor and carrying a shield allows you to form an impregnable defensive
line. Once you engage a foe, he has difficulty moving away to threaten
your allies. If you want to be a front-line melee combatant who defends
the rest of the party and manipulates opponents, the knight is a good
choice.</p>
<p align="left"><b>MAKING A KNIGHT</b></p>
<p align="left">A low-level knight is similar to a cross between a
fighter and a bard. You have many hit points, a high Armor Class, and
an ability similar to bardic music (the knight's challenge class
feature). You can pick a single foe, usually the one who poses the most
dangerous physical threat, and gain a bonus on attack rolls and damage
rolls against that opponent. You must pay close attention to the
knight's code of conduct, since it forbids you from taking advantage of
several tactically useful situations.</p>
<p align="left">You excel in combat in a manner similar to a fighter --
but while a fighter can slay a monster, your primary talent is your
ability to keep that monster away from your allies while you battle it.
It might take you longer to win the day, but your many hit points and
strong defensive abilities help preserve you. Best of all, your defense
enables your allies to function at full capacity without being subject
to the monster's attacks. Any sorcerer or wizard in the party thrives
when you are there to absorb attacks and hold back your mutual foes.</p>
<p align="left">As you advance in level, you gain the ability to
dictate a foe's actions, forcing him to attack you instead of other
targets. Weaker opponents, which typically appear in numbers too large
for you to hold them all back, quail in terror when you menace them.
Even if they slip past you, they take penalties when they attack your
allies. Your knight's challenge and shield block class features combine
to let you excel in one-on-one melee, granting you a bonus on attack
rolls, damage rolls, and Armor Class against a single foe of your
choice. If the group faces a mighty villain or a single, overwhelming
physical threat, it's up to you to keep the monster occupied while your
allies cast their spells or maneuver for position.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Abilities: </b>You benefit from a high Charisma
score, since it determines how often you can use some of your abilities
and the save DC of those abilities. A high Constitution allows you to
increase your already impressive hit point total, thus bolstering your
capacity to defend your allies. Strength improves your combat
abilities, making you more effective as a front-line character.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Races:</b> The majority of knights are dwarves,
humans, and half-elves. The dwarf's tendency toward order, combined
with that race's militaristic bent, gives rise to fighting orders
dedicated to upholding justice and obeying an honorable code. Dwarf
knights also serve as wandering dispensers of justice between isolated
settlements who enforce the rule of law and protect small clanholds.
Humanity, with its sprawling kingdoms and empires, produces many
knights who fight as much for king and country as for personal honor
and monetary rewards. Some half-elves enter into such service as well
and can rise to high ranks within such orders. Gnomes and halflings
rarely become knights, since the knight's straightforward code of
conduct runs counter to the small races' reliance on trickery and
clever planning. Few half-orcs have the opportunity to become knights,
but when they do their natural strength serves them well. Elf knights
are rare, since elves prefer freedom and flexibility over the rigid
code of honor all knights must follow.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Alignment:</b> Knights are always lawful. Their
dedication to a code of conduct is but one expression of their devotion
to order. Most knightly orders arise as institutions forged to protect
a kingdom from invaders or to enforce the law against chaos from within.</p>
<p align="left">While knights value order, they tend in equal numbers
toward good, evil, and neutrality. Lawful good knights see order as a
tool to protect the innocent and weak from evil. Lawful evil knights
believe that the social order serves to reward the strong. Lawful
neutral knights abhor the destruction and suffering that chaos can
bring and so uphold order for its own sake.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Starting Gold:</b> 6d4x10 gp (150 gp).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Starting Age:</b> As paladin (<i>PH </i>109).</p>
<p align="left"><b>CLASS FEATURES </b></p>
<p align="left">Your class features involve mastering the use of armor
and shields and learning how to manipulate your foes so that melee
combat takes place on your terms, not theirs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency:</b> Knights are
proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor
(heavy, medium, and light) and all shields (except tower shields).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Knight's Challenge: </b>Your dauntless fighting
spirit plays a major role in your fighting style, as important as the
strength of your arm or the sharpness of your blade. In battle, you use
the force of your personality to challenge your enemies. You can call
out a foe, shouting a challenge that boosts his confidence, or issue a
general challenge that strikes fear into weak opponents and compels
strong opponents to seek you out for personal combat. By playing on
your enemies' ego, you can manipulate your foes.</p>
<p align="left">You can use this ability a number of times per day
equal to 1/2 your class level + your Charisma bonus (minimum once per
day). As you gain levels, you gain a number of options that you can use
in conjunction with this ability.</p>
<p align="left">Even if you and your foes lack a shared language, you
can still effectively communicate through body language, tone, and
certain oaths and challenges you learn from a variety of different
tongues.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Fighting Challenge (Ex): </i>As a swift action, you
can issue a challenge against a single opponent. The target of this
ability must have an Intelligence of 5 or higher, have a language of
some sort, and have a CR greater than or equal to your character level
minus 2. If it does not meet these requirements, a use of this ability
is expended without effect.</p>
<p align="left">If the target does meet the conditions given above, you
gain a +1 morale bonus on Will saves and a +1 morale bonus on attack
rolls and damage rolls against the target of this ability. You fight
with renewed vigor and energy by placing your honor and reputation on
the line. If your chosen foe reduces you to 0 or fewer hit points, you
lose two uses of your knight's challenge ability for the day because of
the blow to your ego and confidence from this defeat.</p>
<p align="left">The effect of a fighting challenge lasts for a number of rounds equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus (if any).</p>
<p align="left">If you are capable of issuing a knight's challenge more
than once per day, you can use this ability more than once in a single
encounter. If your first chosen foe is defeated or flees the area, you
can issue a new challenge to a different foe. You cannot switch foes if
your original target is still active.</p>
<p align="left">At 7th level, the bonus you gain from this ability
increases to +2. At 13th level, it rises to +3. At 19th level, it
increases to +4.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Test of Mettle (Ex): </i>Starting at 4th level, you
can shout a challenge to all enemies, calling out for the mightiest
among them to face you in combat. Any target of this ability must have
a language of some sort and an Intelligence score of 5 or higher.
Creatures that do not meet these requirements are immune to the test of
mettle. You must have line of sight and line of effect to the targets
of this ability.</p>
<p align="left">As a swift action, you can expend one use of your
knight's challenge ability to cause all your enemies within 100 feet
with a CR greater than or equal to your character level minus 2 to make
Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Cha modifier).
Creatures that fail this save are forced to attack you with their
ranged or melee attacks in preference over other available targets. If
a foe attacks by casting a spell or using a supernatural ability, he
must target you with the attack or include you in the effect's area.</p>
<p align="left">An opponent compelled to act in this manner is not
thrown into a mindless rage and does not have to move to attack you in
melee if doing so would provoke attacks of opportunity against him. In
such a case, he can use ranged attacks against you or attack any
opponents he threatens as normal. If anyone other than you attacks the
target, the effect of the test of mettle ends for that specific target.</p>
<p align="left">If you are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by an
opponent forced to attack you due to this ability, you gain one
additional use of your knight's challenge ability for that day. This
additional use comes from increased confidence and the knowledge that
you have proved your mettle as a knight against your enemies by calling
out foes even against overwhelming odds. This additional use disappears
if you have not used it by the start of the next day. You can only gain
one additional use of your knight's challenge ability in this manner
per day.</p>
<p align="left">The effect of a test of mettle lasts for a number of
rounds equal to 5 + your Charisma bonus (if any). Whether a creature
fails or succeeds on its save against your test of mettle, it can only
be targeted by this effect once per day.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Call to Battle (Ex): </i>Starting at 8th level, you
become an inspiring figure on the battlefield. When all seems lost, you
are a beacon of hope who continues to fight on despite the odds. No
cause is yet lost when a knight still battles on its name.</p>
<p align="left">As a swift action, you can expend one use of your
knight's challenge ability to grant an ally another save against a fear
effect. The target gains a bonus on this save equal to your Charisma
bonus (if any). If the target succeeds on this save, he gains the
benefit for a successful save against the attack or spell. This ability
reflects your talent to inspire your allies in the face of a daunting
foe.</p>
<p align="left">For example, Lidda fails her save against a lich's <i>fear </i>spell.
On his next action, Sir Agrivail uses his call to battle ability to
grant Lidda another save. If she succeeds, she immediately shrugs off
the effect of the <i>fear </i>spell.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Daunting Challenge (Ex): </i>Starting at 12th level,
you can call out opponents, striking fear into the hearts of your
enemies. In this manner you separate the strong-minded from the
weak-willed, allowing you to focus on opponents that are worthy foes.</p>
<p align="left">As a swift action, you can expend one use of your
knight's challenge ability to issue a daunting challenge. This ability
affects all creatures within 100 feet of you that have a CR less than
your character level minus 2. Targets must be able to hear you, speak
or understand a language of some sort, and have an Intelligence score
of 5 or more. All targets who meet these conditions must make Will
saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Cha modifier) or become
shaken.</p>
<p align="left">Whether a creature fails or succeeds on its save
against your daunting challenge, it can only be targeted by this effect
once per day.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Bond of Loyalty (Ex): </i>Starting at 16th level,
your loyalty to your comrades endures even in the face of powerful
magic. You can expend one use of your knight's challenge ability to
make an additional saving throw against a mindaffecting spell or
ability. You can use this ability once per round as a free action and
can continue to use it even if an opponent is controlling your actions
with a mind-affecting spell or ability.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Loyal Beyond Death (Ex): </i>At 20th level, if you
are reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by an effect that otherwise leaves
your body intact, you can expend one use of your knight's challenge
ability to remain conscious and continue to act for 1 more round before
dying. You can use this ability even if your hit point total is -10 or
lower. If your body is somehow destroyed before your next action (such
as by <i>disintegrate</i>), then you cannot act. You can continue to
expend uses of your knight's challenge ability to survive from round to
round until you run out of uses. If you receive healing that leaves you
with more than -10 hit points, you survive (or fall unconscious, as
appropriate to your new hit point total) when you stop using this
ability. Otherwise, death overtakes you when you run out of uses of
your knight's challenge ability.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The Knight's Code:</b> You fight not only to defeat
your foes but to prove your honor, demonstrate your fighting ability,
and win renown across the land. The stories that arise from your deeds
are just as important to you as the deeds themselves. A good knight
hopes that her example encourages others to lead righteous lives. A
neutral knight wishes to uphold the cause of his liege (if he has one)
and win glory. An evil knight seeks to win acclaim across the land and
increase her own personal power.</p>
<p align="left">The knight's code focuses on fair play: A victory
achieved through pure skill is more difficult, and hence wins more
glory, than one achieved through trickery or guile.</p>
<ul>
<li> A knight does not gain a bonus on attack rolls when flanking. You
still confer the benefi t of a flanking position to your ally, but you
forgo your own +2 bonus on attack rolls. You can choose to keep the +2
bonus, but doing so violates your code of honor (see below).<br><br></li>
<li> A knight never strikes a flat-footed opponent. Instead, you allow your foe to ready himself before attacking.<br><br></li>
<li> A knight never deals lethal damage against a helpless foe. You can
strike such a foe, but only with attacks that deal nonlethal damage.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">If you violate any part of this code, you lose one use
of your knight's challenge ability for the day. If your knight's
challenge ability is not available when you violate the code (for
example, if you have exhausted your uses for the day), you take a -2
penalty on attack rolls and saves for the rest of that day. Your
betrayal of your code of conduct undermines the foundation of
confidence and honor that drives you forward.</p>
<p align="left">While you cleave to your view of honor, chivalry, and
pursuit of glory, you do not force your views on others. You might
chide a rogue for sneaking around a battlefield, but you recognize (and
perhaps even feel a bit smug about) the reality that not everyone is
fit to follow the knight's path.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Mounted Combat: </b>At 2nd level, you gain Mounted Combat as a bonus feat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shield Block (Ex):</b> Starting at 2nd level, you
excel in using your armor and shield to frustrate your enemy's attacks.
During your action, designate a single opponent as the target of this
ability. Your shield bonus to AC against that foe increases by 1, as
you move your shield to defl ect an incoming blow, possibly providing
just enough protection to turn a telling swing into a near miss.</p>
<p align="left">This shield bonus increases to +2 at 11th level and +3 at 20th level.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bulwark of Defense (Ex):</b> When you reach 3rd
level, an opponent that begins its turn in your threatened area treats
all the squares that you threaten as difficult terrain. Your strict
vigilance and active defensive maneuvers force your opponents to move
with care.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Armor Mastery (Ex):</b> Starting at 4th level, you
are able to wear your armor like a second skin and ignore the standard
speed reduction for wearing medium armor. Starting at 9th level, you
ignore the speed reduction imposed by heavy armor as well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Bonus Feat:</b> At 5th level, you gain a bonus feat
chosen from the following list: Animal Affinity, Diehard, Endurance,
Great Fortitude, Iron Will, Quick Draw, Ride-By Attack, Spirited
Charge, Trample, or Weapon Focus (lance). You must still meet any
prerequisites for the feat. You gain an additional bonus feat from this
list at 10th level and again at 15th level.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Vigilant Defender (Ex):</b> Starting at 5th level,
you stand your ground against all enemies, warding the spot where you
make your stand to prevent foes from slipping past and attacking those
you protect. If an opponent attempts to use the Tumble skill to move
through your threatened area or your space without provoking attacks of
opportunity, the Tumble check DC to avoid your attacks of opportunity
increases by an amount equal to your class level.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Shield Ally (Ex):</b> Starting at 6th level, as an
immediate action you can opt to absorb part of the damage dealt to an
adjacent ally. Each time this ally takes damage from a physical attack
before your next turn, you can take half this damage on yourself. The
target takes the other half as normal. You can only absorb damage from
physical melee attacks and ranged attacks, such as an incoming arrow or
a blow from a sword, not from spells and other effects.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Improved Shield Ally (Ex):</b> At 14th level, your
ability to absorb damage increases. Once per round you can absorb all
the damage from a single attack directed against an adjacent ally. In
addition, you continue to absorb half the damage from other physical
attacks on an adjacent ally, if you so choose. You must decide whether
to use this ability after the attacker determines that an attack has
succeeded but before he rolls damage.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Impetuous Endurance (Ex):</b> Starting at 17th
level, your fighting spirit enables you to push your body beyond the
normal limits of endurance. You no longer automatically fail a saving
throw on a roll of 1. You might still fail the save if your result
fails to equal or beat the DC.</p>
<p align="left"><b>PLAYING A KNIGHT</b></p>
<p align="left">As a knight, you are driven to prove your abilities,
showcase the code of chivalry as a proper way to live, and defend your
allies. You are impetuous and brave, never backing down from a
challenge. When you face a mighty foe, you take a moment to call out a
challenge to him, salute his fighting ability, or list his crimes that
you seek to avenge.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Religion</b></p>
<p align="left">Knights value order and honor in all things. They
worship lawful gods, though whether their patrons are good, neutral, or
evil depends solely on the knight's preferences. Good knights favor
Heironeous, while neutral ones follow St. Cuthbert. Evil knights, if
they venerate a god, offer prayers to Hextor. Knights of Heironeous and
Hextor are renowned for the epic duels they have fought against each
other. Opposing armies sometimes halt their advance to allow these
sworn enemies to duel to the death before the rest of the battle is
joined.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Other Classes</b></p>
<p align="left">You respect paladins for their skill in combat and
devotion to a code of conduct, although their path is somewhat
different from your own. You see wizards, sorcerers, clerics, and bards
as useful allies who should stay back away from combat; individual
knights sometimes travel partnered with a member of one of these
classes. Most knights consider barbarians to be crazed lunatics who
lack the honor, self-control, and training to fight in a proper
civilized manner, yet a skilled barbarian can earn a knight's grudging
respect through deeds in battle. You have little regard for rogues,
beguilers, or others who rely on stealth or deceit. In general, you
have no feeling one way or the other toward druids, monks, and rangers.
You distrust the duskblade's mix of melee combat and spellcasting but
can empathize with the dragon shaman's devotion to his totem dragon,
though you might be wary of particular shamans (those devoted to
chaotic dragons). In general, you feel protective (but with a touch of
condescension) toward adventurers who cannot handle heavy armor and
weapons.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Combat</b></p>
<p align="left">You serve two basic roles in battle. You excel at
dominating the field of battle, since your defensive abilities make it
difficult for opponents to move past you and strike vulnerable members
of your party. You believe that the best way to face an enemy is to
challenge him to an honorable duel and kill him fair and square,
claiming all the glory for yourself. When faced with multiple foes, you
can strike fear into some and goad others into attacking you rather
than your allies. You are the sorcerer's, wizard's, or bard's best
friend. Your commanding presence draws attacks to you, while your hit
points and heavy armor make you ideally suited to absorb blows. While
you are engaging foes in combat, your allies can use their spells and
special abilities without interference.</p>
