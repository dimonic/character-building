following article focuses on wizards when it comes to the crafting of
magic items (and getting stuck with the XP bill). However, artificers
receive a number of craft points each level to offset XP costs; should
they run out of craft points, they might consider the following options
as well.</td>

<p align="left">Wizards, with their surplus of item creation and
metamagic bonus feats, are the most likely to stare down expectations
when monster loot fails to deliver that "perfectly convenient" piece of
treasure (tailored for each party member). While player characters
typically amass and spend gold without reservation, no adventurer is
willingly parted from their XP. A wizard, with the right item creation
feat and prerequisite spells, can potentially create any magic item
desired by their companions. Expecting them to continually pay the XP
bill, however, is basically like asking, "Do you mind lagging behind
the average party level?" It's understandable that some wizards avoid
certain item creation feats, believing that the glut of requests asked
of them by taking (for instance) Craft Magic Arms and Armor will
detrimentally impact their progress. As such, wizards are often likely
to choose Craft Staff or Craft Wand, to avoid being put into an
obligatory position (and, of course, because such feats are genuinely
useful for their profession).</p>
<p align="left"><img src="transfering_XP_costs_files/dx0526we_phb2we_1.jpg" align="right" border="1" height="317" width="240">Yet
wizards might not feel so put upon taking Forge Ring, Craft Wondrous
Item, or even Craft Magic Arms and Armor if there was a straightforward
way to transfer the XP costs onto their intended owners. For example,
if the party's fighter pays the 720 XP cost for their own <i>+2 keen bastard sword</i>, the wizard could still make a <i>+1 returning spell storing dagger</i>
for themselves without falling behind in level. Moreover, weapons,
items and rings can be imbued with persistent or renewable effects,
unlike typical spell-trigger items that are consumed or run out of
charges; to elaborate, by spending an extra 2,000 gp and 80 XP, the
abovementioned dagger can be made to permanently <i>detect magic</i> at will (see Table 7-33: Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values, page 285 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left">The following article explores several game options for
transferring XP costs when creating magic items. While it may be easy
enough to simply say "the fighter pays the XP cost for their own sword"
a few additional considerations are discussed below.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Requirements for Transferring XP</b></p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#f5f5f5" border="1" bordercolor="#cccccc" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="240"><tbody><tr><td>While
the first rule states that the transfer must be willing, you might
devise NPC villains who've managed the means to circumvent this (after
all, what is that about rules made to be broken?). <i>Book of Vile Darkness</i> introduced the <i>armor of the dread emperor</i> (see pg. 111), which distributed any damage done to the wearer to prisoners chained to the armor. A similar item (see the <i>talisman of transference</i>)
might be employed by evil wizards, transferring the XP cost to them
from chained prisoners during the process of item creation.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left"><b>Rule #1: </b>The first rule of transferring XP to
create a magic item is that the creature must be willing to participate
in the exchange. Any attempt at coercion, through magical or mundane
means, to transfer XP will automatically fail. The XP cost for creating
a magic item can only be freely transferred in complete awareness of
the consequences, which also necessitates a minimum Intelligence of 3.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rule #2: </b>Furthermore, a creature cannot transfer
so much XP toward creating a magic item as to lose a level. However,
such a creature may, upon gaining enough XP to attain a new level,
transfer this XP toward creating a magic item rather than keeping them
and advancing a level.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Rule #3: </b>Lastly, a creature can only transfer XP
toward creating a magic item with which they are proficient (regarding
armors, shields, and weapons), capable of activating (in the case of
wands, and other spell trigger items[1]), or capable of using (if
restricted by ability score, alignment, class feature, or race [1]).</p>
<p align="left">[1] A creature can attempt to emulate these qualities with a Use Magic Device check in order to transfer XP.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Compensation for Transferring XP</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="transfering_XP_costs_files/dx0526we_phb2we_2.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="272" width="240">If
you are commissioning a magic item for which you are willing to
transfer the XP cost, a discount of 5 gp per 1 XP is subtracted from
the final market price.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Note</i>: Magic items based on spells with XP
components increase the market price by 5 gp per 1 XP (see Table 7-33:
Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values, page 285 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<p align="left">The only time NPCs are willing to transfer the XP costs
for creating magic items is when they are cohorts or followers of some
member in the party, or the magic item is being made for their personal
use (for example, when an NPC commissions a magic item).</p>
<p align="left">If an NPC is able and willing to transfer the XP cost
for creating a magic item, the compensation for this service is 5 gp
per 1 XP, paid in advance. While XP is an abstract concept to NPCs,
this is the minimum amount that will be accepted. A greedy NPC who is
"in character" will likely ask for even more gold, especially if they
fulfill multiple requirements for transferring XP.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Sharing the Transferred XP Costs</b></p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#f5f5f5" border="1" bordercolor="#cccccc" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="240"><tbody><tr><td><i>Note</i>:
While it may seem like PCs can pawn off magic item XP costs onto their
cohorts or followers, doing so actually puts them at a greater
disadvantage than if they simply paid the magic item creator to use
their own XP. The cost is exactly the same (5 gp per 1 XP), but cohorts
or followers who pay the XP cost start to lag behind in level, becoming
less effective in the party.</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">A creature that meets all requirements for transferring
XP cost may transfer the full amount or a partial amount. Partial
amounts typically range between 25%, 50%, and 75%, but can be any
number of XP stipulated by the creature (essentially, until they say
"when"). Up to five creatures can share the transferred XP cost of
creating a magic item, split into equal or disproportionate amounts.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Repairing Magic Items</b></p>
<p align="left">All the rules for creating magic items with transferred XP apply to repairing magic items as well.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Methods of Transferring XP</b></p>
<p align="left">Below are three different methods of transferring XP to
the creator of a magic item. Each approach is slightly different and
requires various degrees of involvement.</p>
<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Spell</b></p>
<p align="left">This first method of transferring XP utilizes a
universal spell available to all spellcasters. This method offers more
security for the spellcaster than it does for the person transferring
XP.</p>
<p align="left"><b>TRANSFERENCE<br></b>Universal<br><b>Level:</b> Bard 1, Cleric 1, Druid 1, Sorcerer/wizard 1<br><b>Components:</b> V, S, F<br><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes<br><b>Range:</b> 10 ft.<br><b>Target:</b> 10-ft.-radius burst centered on you<br><b>Duration:</b> Permanent; see text<br><b>Saving Throw:</b> Will negates (harmless)<br><b>Spell Resistance:</b> No</p>
<p align="left"><i>Wisps of ethereal light rise off the targeted
creatures, consolidate into glowing orbs, and then streak toward the
spellcaster, fusing with their body.</i></p>
<p align="left">This spell allows you to store a transfer of XP from
one or more creatures (maximum five), but only for the purpose of
constructing an agreed upon magic item. The XP gained from other
creatures through this spell is not counted toward attaining a new
level. Targeted creatures must agree to the focus component that will
be used in creating the magic item before allowing this spell to be
cast on them. Once the spell is cast, targeted creatures control how
much XP to transfer. You cannot accept a transfer of more XP than is
needed to construct the agreed upon magic item. All the requirements
for transferring XP, compensating for XP, and sharing XP costs apply to
the casting of this spell.</p>
<p align="left">If allowable changes are made that require more XP, you
must provide that XP yourself or cast this spell again to store a
transfer of more XP as needed. If allowable changes are made that
require less XP, the difference is returned to the targeted creatures
in proportionate amounts (as per their original contributions). If you
start making a magic item that is not allowed by even one of the
targeted creatures, all the transferred XP is immediately returned to
those creatures. If you spend at least one day making the agreed upon
magic item, the XP is consumed regardless of whether the magic item is
completed or not. If you start working on a new magic item after
spending at least one day making the agreed upon magic item, the XP is
consumed and lost (as per the normal rules for creating magic items).</p>
<p align="left"><i>Focus: </i>The raw material of agreed upon magic item (for example, a cloak, sword, or wand).</p>
<p align="left"><b>One Line:</b></p>
<p align="left">Univ <b>Transference(F):</b> Transfers XP from a creature to create an agreed upon magic item.</p>
<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Magic Item</b></p>
<p align="left">This second method of transferring XP relies on an
inexpensive magic item that anybody can use. This method offers more
security for the person transferring XP than it does for the creator of
a magic item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Talisman of Transference</b></p>
<p align="left">A <i>talisman of transference</i> is a conduit through which XP can be transferred for the purposes of constructing an agreed upon magic item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Lore:</b> These devices were designed to protect
creatures that commissioned magic items from creators who spent their
transferred XP and did not finish the contract or disappeared with the
completed product (Gather Information DC 20 or Knowledge [arcana] DC
10).</p>
<p align="left"><b>Description:</b> A <i>talisman of transference</i> typically takes the shape of a bracer, periapt, or some other form of jewelry worn against the skin.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Activation:</b> As a standard action, a worn <i>talisman of transference </i>is
brought into contact with the raw material of an agreed upon magic item
(for example, a cloak, sword, or wand) before construction begins, with
the wearer speaking the word "attach" to create a link. The worn <i>talisman of transference </i>is
then brought into contact with the creator after at least one day (8
hours) has been spent working on the magic item (but usually upon
completion), speaking the word "infuse" to complete the effect.</p>
<p align="left">A <i>talisman of transference </i>can only form a
connection with one raw material at a time. Speaking the word "attach"
while in contact with a new raw material erases the old link.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Effect:</b> A <i>talisman of transference</i>
transfers XP from the wearer to the person who constructed the magic
item, so long as the magic item was made from the original raw material
to which this device was linked. The wearer can transfer the entire or
partial amount, though the wearer cannot transfer more XP than was
needed to construct the magic item. All the requirements for
transferring XP, compensating for XP, and sharing XP costs apply to
using this device.</p>
<p align="left">If the wearer refuses to transfer XP for the magic
item, the creator can destroy the magic item, thereby regaining any XP
that was invested. The monetary investment, however, is still lost.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Aura/Caster Level: </b>Faint universal. CL 1st.<br><b>Construction: </b>Requires Craft Wondrous Item, <i>transference </i>spell, 100 gp, 16 XP, 1 day.<br><b>Weight: </b>1/2 lb.<br><b>Price: </b>200 gp.</p>
<p class="size3red" align="left"><b>Ceremony Feat</b></p>
<p align="left">This third method of transferring XP is a feat taken by
the magic item creator. This method offers nearly equal security for
both the person transferring XP and the creator of a magic item, as
both parties continually work together.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Ritual Transference</b></p>
<p align="left"><img src="transfering_XP_costs_files/dx0526we_phb2we_3.jpg" align="right" border="0" height="224" width="240">You
can transfer the XP of other creatures into an agreed upon magic item
and construct magic items with prerequisites that you do not meet.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion), any item creation feat.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Benefit:</b> You gain access to rituals based on
your ranks in Knowledge (arcana) or Knowledge (religion). If you
qualified for this feat with Knowledge (arcana), only magic items with
arcane spell prerequisites can be constructed with the transfer ritual.
If you qualified for this feat with Knowledge (religion), only magic
items with divine spell prerequisites can be constructed with the
transfer ritual.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Transfer (Knowledge [arcana] 4 ranks or Knowledge [religion] 4 ranks):</i>
You can courier a transfer of XP from one or more creatures (maximum
five) into an agreed upon magic item you are constructing. Any
creatures participating in this ritual control how much XP to transfer.
You cannot courier a transfer of more XP than is needed to construct
the agreed upon magic item. All the requirements for transferring XP,
compensating for XP, and sharing XP costs apply to participating in
this ritual.</p>
<p align="left">If allowable changes are made that require more XP, you
or the participating creatures must provide that XP as needed. If
allowable changes are made that require less XP, the difference is
returned to you or the participating creatures in proportionate amounts
(as per their original contributions). If you start making a magic item
that is not allowed by even one of the creatures participating in this
ritual, all the transferred XP is returned to those creatures. If you
spend at least one day making the agreed upon magic item, the XP is
consumed regardless of whether the magic item is completed or not. If
you start working on a new magic item after spending at least one day
making the agreed upon magic item, the XP is consumed and lost (as per
the normal rules for creating magic items).</p>
<p align="left">Any creatures participating in this ritual must be
present while the magic item is being created (one day per 1,000 gp in
the item's base price, 8 hours per day; potions always take just one
day to make, regardless of cost). If any creatures participating in
this ritual are not present, then no progress can be made toward the
magic item that day. If any creature leaves before 8 hours per day has
elapsed, no portion of that day counts toward the construction time.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Coalesce (Knowledge [arcana] 8 ranks or Knowledge [religion] 8 ranks):</i>
You can rely on any creature participating in this ritual who
transferred at least 50% of the XP cost to provide prerequisite spells
for the agreed upon magic item. The creature must provide any material
components or focuses the spells require, and must pay any XP costs
required for the spells. The act of constructing the magic item
triggers these spells, making them unavailable for casting during each
day of the magic item's creation.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Note</i>: If you are commissioning the creation of a
magic item from an NPC with this feat (for which you are providing
spells), a discount consistent with your contribution and type of magic
item is subtracted from the final market price (see Table 7-33:
Estimating Magic Item Gold Piece Values, page 285 of the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i>).</p>
<table align="right" bgcolor="#f5f5f5" border="1" bordercolor="#cccccc" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="240"><tbody><tr><td><i>Note: </i>Here's a bit of trivia. The one magic item in the <i>Dungeon Master's Guide</i> that normally allows for collaboration is the <i>horn of the tritons</i>, which states that the "creator must be a triton or get construction aid from a triton".</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p align="left">Similarly, you can rely on any creature participating
in this ritual who transferred at least 50% of the XP cost to provide
ability score, alignment, character level, class level, class feature,
race, or skill rank prerequisites for the agreed upon magic item. No
discount is given for providing these qualities. You must always
provide the caster level and item creation feat needed to make a magic
item.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Special:</b> A character who meets the prerequisites automatically gains Ritual Transference as a bonus feat after constructing five <i>talismans of transference</i>.</p>
