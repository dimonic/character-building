Session 2: Vrath's Keep

After a 24 of down-time, the party left town, and headed up the Don
Way towards Vrath's keep. Rehotep has acquired a real warhorse, but no
other major changes have occurred (other than the fact that the
Rogue/Wizard now has a name: Vossil).

The heat is oppresive, so Rehotep casts endure elements on the
armoured dwarf, and eventually on himself and Parn the
hexblade. Vossil suffers from the heat, but Rehotep does not have
enough spells to help. After a couple of hours, we find the trail that
would lead to Jorr, the local ranger, and we detour to his
dwelling. Enlisting his aid (he hates goblins), we then travel
on. Near the keep, we come to an area of swamp crossed by a
boardwalk. A waggon lies off the trail half submerged, and goblinoid
corpses lie around it. On closer investigation, a hydra emerges and
attacks the party (Rehotep, Parn and Tik-Tir closed with it). After a
swift but brutal battle, the hydra is slain by massive damage, and a
search by Rehotep reveals a sweet mithral breastplate worn by the
Hobgloblin commander! Rehotep dons the armour, accepting the 15%
arcane spell failure percentage.
